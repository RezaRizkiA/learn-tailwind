# Why?

Many people consider 
`CSS` difficult.

![css-awesome](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/25721528/adec307c-3108-11e7-8f66-10edae56e6f0.png)

We think _everyone_ building web apps/sites
should **learn `CSS`**. <br />
However we _agree_ that it can feel frustrating 
and often overwhelming.
Many software engineers/developers
feel they already have _enough_ to learn
with the rest of their chosen 
["stack"](https://github.com/dwyl/technology-stack),
so investing the time 
to perfect the _interface_ design & layout 
feels like too much.
We get it!


Learning **`Tailwind`** 
will not mean 
you don't need to learn/understand `CSS`.
But it will make it easier.


> We think the infamy of `CSS` is unjustified.
Like learning how to 
[juggle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juggling),
you will get hit in the face 
by a few stray objects
in your quest to learn `CSS`.
If you invest the time 
to learn `CSS` from first principals,
you will have the skills
to avoid the frustration.


> As with most things,
it's usually just a matter of taking the time 
to learn/understand how things work.
But for some reason many engineers 
don't want to invest the time 
to learn `CSS` 



## Why _switch_ to `Tailwind`? 

We have not taken the decision to "switch"
our UI library _lightly_.
As with all technology decisions,
we _must_ weigh the pros & cons _carefully_
because there is a substantial time investment required.

###¬†What about `XYZ` Framework?

There is a virtually _endless_ list of 
https://dev.to/samlan/best-css-frameworks-for-2022-1afm
### What about `Tachyons`?

We were _happy_ with
**`Tachyons`**
and still think it's _great_!
even more so considering
we were _already_ happy with
the CSS framwork we were using; 
**`Tayc

We have been using 
[**`Taychyons`**](https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons/#docs)
for the past 5 years
and documented our learning in
[dwyl/**learn-tachyons**](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-tachyons)
and 
[dwyl/**tachyons-bootstrap**](https://github.com/dwyl/tachyons-bootstrap).
We still ‚ù§Ô∏è it and will use it where it makes sense.



# What?



**`Tailwind`** has several key advantages:

1. **Declarative utility focussed `CSS`** classes
   that allow you to **in-line** the **styles** in UI element
   so you never have to hunt for a style definition across multiple files.
2. **Built-in pre-processor bundles** and _minimises_ your `CSS`
   Never ship bloated `CSS` again; especially important for larger projects.
3. **Actively developed** by the original author 
   who is still passionate about the project,
   see: 
   [What's New in `Tailwind` 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOQyWbPO2Ds&t=137s&ab_channel=TailwindLabs)
   where 
4. **_Thriving_ community** with _many_ contributors, 
   see: [github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss)
5. **UI Library** [not free but very reasonably priced!]
   which means there is a **_sustainable_ business model** 
   i.e. it wont cease to be maintained

Bonus:

1. Looks likely `Tailwind` will be included 
   in a future `Phoenix` release ...
   Given that 


# Who?

This guide is aimed at anyone
that:

A. Wants to _evaluate_ `Tailwind` for themselves
without the hype. <br />
B. Needs to learn `Tailwind` 
as fast as possible
but without skipping any steps! <br />
C. Has to _summarise_ & _share_ 
their knowledge of `Tailwind`
with a team/community of people.

# How? 

If you just want to test
`Tailwind` with the least effort,
use the online playground:
[play.tailwindcss.com](https://play.tailwindcss.com/)

![tailwind-play-color-change](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/174629457-cda42165-8242-4f04-afe1-8d7c75da6c2b.gif)


Speed-read through the docs: 
[tailwindcss.com/**docs/utility-first**](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first)
and try a changing a few values,
e.g: start by changing color names.

## Part 1: `Try` _Before_ You `Commit` 

The _official_
[**get started guide**](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)
instructs you to perform several setup (installation) steps 
***`before`***
you try the framework. 
But you can skip these steps
if you just want to _evaluate_ it.

### Create `index.html`

Create an `index.html` file 
on your computer 
with the following contents:

```html

```

## Part 2: `Tailwind` in `Phoenix`



If you just want to learn `Tailwind` without `Phoenix`,






We're already using `Tailwind` for our `Phoenix LiveView` Chat Example:
https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-liveview-chat-example

We think it's _siiiiiiick_!
So we'll be writing up our notes soon.
